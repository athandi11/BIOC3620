# Experiential Learning Project 
Primary sequence based deep learning model for the prediction of the mechanical properties of dragline silk.

The mechanical properties of these fibers depend strongly on their amino acid sequences. While many studies have 
aimed to elucidate this sequence-property relationship, definitive validation remains incomplete in the current 
literature. This project uses machine learning to train and test a convolutional neural network (CNN) to explore 
this relationship. The model takes amino acid sequences to predict four mechanical properties, youngâ€™s modulus, 
toughness, tensile strength, and strain at break. 

The mechanical properties and primary sequences were obtained from the so-called Spider Silkome Database (SSD): https://spider-silkome.org/
